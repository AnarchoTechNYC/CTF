## Pull requests or commits

Please keep the following guidelines in mind *when you open new pull requests or make new commits* to this repository:

* **Provide hints, not solutions.** Remember that this repository is for peer education first, posterity second. Most CTF writeups give away the answer, depriving readers of the opportunity to self-educate by exploring on their own. Instead of providing solutions directly, offer hints at the next stage of a problem. This can be tricky, so consider opening a new issue to discuss it before writing a solution.
