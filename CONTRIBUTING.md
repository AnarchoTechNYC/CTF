# Contribution guidelines

Thanks for your contribution! :) Before you propose some changes, please have a quick glance at the following guidelines.

## Pull requests or commits

Please keep the following guidelines in mind *when you open new pull requests or make new commits* to this repository:

* **Provide hints, not solutions.** Remember that this repository is for peer education first, posterity second. Most CTF writeups give away the answer to a challenge, depriving readers of the opportunity to self-educate by exploring on their own. Instead of providing solutions directly, offer hints for reaching the next stage of a problem. This can be tricky, so consider opening a new issue to discuss it before writing a solution.
* **Explain why, not just how.** If you are going to write a solutions guide or full challenge walkthrough, then your writeup must also explain *why* a given solution works, not just *that* it works. This way, a reader will be able to derive the general principle from the solution and gain an understanding of how to apply that principle to other challenges they encounter in the future. Be succinct, but thorough when doing this.
* **Include relevant complementary tips.** Look for and follow up on good educational opportunities that are related to the challenge, even if they may not be directly related to a solution. Many challenges can be solved in a number of different ways, and the more you know about a given a specialty, the more information details provide. Point out *all* the relevant details. Explain why and how different approaches, or hybrid approaches, can solve the same problem.
