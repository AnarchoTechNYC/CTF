[Capture The Flag competitions](https://github.com/AnarchoTechNYC/meta/wiki/InfoSec#ctfs-and-hacking-games) often supply a number of small attachments or puzzle files. This repository is a collection of those assets and associated write-ups describing how to approach the challenge. The aim is to build an archive of challenges that our team members know how to tackle so as to educate our peers.

In other words, we put the "ethical" back into "ethical hacking."
